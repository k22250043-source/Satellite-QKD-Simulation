# Satellite-to-Ground BB84 Quantum Key Distribution Simulation

This project implements the BB84 quantum key distribution protocol using state-vector simulation and extends it to a free-space satellite communication model.

## Features
- State-vector representation of qubits
- Born-rule measurement simulation
- QBER computation
- Intercept-resend attack modeling (~25% disturbance)
- Atmospheric photon loss and turbulence modeling
- Key rate vs transmission efficiency analysis

## Tools
Python, NumPy, Matplotlib
